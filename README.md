# idctbh's Sucky Parkour Mod
## An attempt in making 1.19 parkour livable

![N](https://i.imgur.com/JAKQ0GR.png)

SuckyPKMod is a 1.19.x ready mod that will attempt to
bring livable parkour to the newer version. There isn't
a lot that can be done about the hardcode of Minecraft;
X/Z facing - redundant mechanics etc. . . However this mod
will attempt in resurrecting the visual experience of 1.8 parkour.

> Note: This is a `low-effort` project, and I do not see myself actively working with it over time.
